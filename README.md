# **📊 HR Attrition Data Analysis System**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition (turnover) using Data Mining techniques. The goal is to identify factors driving employee departures, predict high-risk employees, and provide actionable strategies to improve retention and workforce stability.

# **📦 Dataset**
The dataset contains 13,423 employees with 39 features, including demographics, job role, salary, performance ratings, overtime, and tenure — providing a solid foundation for attrition prediction.

# **🔍 Features & Techniques**
-  **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Clean, encode, scale, and balance data (using SMOTE) to prepare for modeling.
-  **📊 Clustering Analysis**: Segment employees into distinct groups (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to tailor HR interventions.
-  **🤖 Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost to predict attrition risk.
-  **💾 Model Storage & Reusability**: Trained models stored as .pkl files for easy deployment.
-  **📈 Association Rule Mining**: Discover patterns linking employee attributes (e.g., overtime, years at company) to attrition.
  
# **🛠 Tech Stack**
-  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
-  Machine Learning (Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost)
-  Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
-  Association Rule Mining (Apriori, FP-Growth)

# **🌟 Project Impact**
Helps organizations reduce attrition, optimize employee retention strategies, target high-risk employees, and improve overall workforce management.
